# SLIDE 4: Real-World Use Case

## 📖 Case Study: E-Commerce Platform Crisis

### **The Situation:**
An online shopping platform experiences sudden slowness during peak hours. Customers complaining, sales dropping.

---

### **Traditional Approach ❌**
**Without Service Cure Insights:**

⏱️ **Time:** 4+ hours  
👥 **People:** 3 engineers  
📝 **Process:**
1. Manually grep through 100+ log files
2. Copy/paste suspicious errors into docs
3. Cross-reference timestamps across services
4. Multiple meetings to discuss findings
5. Trial and error to identify root cause

💸 **Cost:** Lost sales, frustrated customers, wasted engineering time

---

### **With Service Cure Insights ✅**
**Smart Approach:**

⏱️ **Time:** 5 minutes  
👥 **People:** 1 engineer  
📝 **Process:**
1. Upload logs from all services
2. Ask: "Why is the system slow during peak hours?"
3. AI identifies: Database connection pool exhausted
4. Ask: "Show me database connection errors"
5. Dashboard reveals: 500+ connection timeouts in last hour

**AI Response Provides:**
- **Root Cause:** Connection pool size (50) too small for traffic
- **Quick Fix:** Increase pool size to 200
- **Long-term Solution:** Implement connection pooling monitoring

💡 **Resolution:** Issue fixed in 10 minutes after identification

---

### **Impact Comparison:**

| Metric | Traditional | Service Cure Insights |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Time to Identify** | 4 hours | 5 minutes |
| **Engineers Needed** | 3 | 1 |
| **Downtime** | 4+ hours | 15 minutes |
| **Revenue Lost** | $50,000 | $1,000 |
| **Customer Complaints** | 500+ | 20 |

**ROI:** 48x faster resolution, 50x cost savings
